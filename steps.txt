1.  tokens are the terminals
2.  in lex, the values have to returned.

questions - 
1.  wouldn't there be a single .y file? then why do I have to define
    the tokens first and then write the bison specification?
2.  when yacc does syntax analysis, it does things in interactive mode.
    what modifications need to be made in lex such that it works?
